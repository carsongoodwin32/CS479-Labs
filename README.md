# CS479 Labs and Final Project

## Overview

This repository contains the lab assignments and final project for the CS479 course. The labs and projects involve various tasks, including data processing, Arduino programming, 3D modeling, and more. Each lab is organized into specific folders, and the final project combines multiple aspects of what was learned throughout the course.

## Installation and Setup

To use any of the provided code:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/CS479-Labs.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the specific lab or final project directory:
   ```bash
   cd CS479-Labs/labX  # Replace X with the specific lab number
   ```
3. Follow the specific instructions provided within each lab or project folder.

## Usage

Each lab and the final project contains its own set of instructions and code files. You can find these within the respective folders. The `.pde` files are Processing scripts, `.ino` files are Arduino sketches, and `.ipynb` files are Jupyter notebooks.
